## About

Hi! I'm **Kin**, I am a **software engineer** working in the processing, containerization, and visualization of scientific workflows. I have worked across multiple domains, from cybersecurity, developing advanced email phishing detection, to open source, enhancing repository insights,
and accessibility.

My main interest is in **cloud-native infrastructure and DevOps tooling**, with a focus on **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, and **CI/CD** pipelines. I also enjoy contributing to open source (**OSS**) projects and working with tools that help improve and support the cloud-native community.

## Connect with me

As Miyamoto Musashi said, "**_The purpose of today’s training is to defeat yesterday’s understanding_**" so, if you’re working on something interesting that I can learn from, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
